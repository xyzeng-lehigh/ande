# ande
Analysis tool of numerical methods for differential equations

# basic terminology
 - tframe:  time-integration method
    *   "MOL" (method of lines)     : "SEMI", "FE", "BE", "CN", ...
 - sframe:  discretization in space
    *   "FD" (finite difference)
    *   "FV" (finite volume)
    *   "HV" (hybrid variable)
 - stencil: determines which scheme given tframe and/or sframe
 - task:    waht to compute/plot/display
    *   "COEF"
